# Contributing

1. Open an Issue describing the bug/feature.
2. Use a short branch name (e.g. `fix-delay-coupling`).
3. Keep changes minimal and add a note in the PR describing what changed and why.
4. PRs are not accepted unless requested.
5. If a fix is requested, it must include a test or a tiny script that demonstrates the bug and confirms the fix.

For research reproducibility:
- Prefer adding a new script/notebook rather than rewriting an existing one.
- Record random seeds and parameter files in outputs.
